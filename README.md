## Associate Software Engineer Coding Assignment Submission 

### I've finished all tasks, including two coding questions and three web development tasks, which I've added to this repository. The web development tasks are also deployed for easy review.

### Profile Card:
A responsive profile card designed using HTML and CSS. It includes a profile picture, name, designation, short bio, social media icons, and features a hover effect with CSS animations.

### To-Do List App:
A simple to-do list application built using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Users can add new tasks, view them in a list, and remove tasks as needed. To maintain data persistence across page reloads, the application utilizes localStorage. This ensures that tasks are retained even after the user closes the browser or reloads the page.

### DOM Manipulation - Image Slider:
An image slider created using JavaScript that displays one image at a time. It features Next and Previous buttons for navigation and uses an array of image URLs.
